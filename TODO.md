# TODO

## Completed
- [x] Create README.md with project documentation
- [x] Create TODO.md for task tracking
- [x] Create CLAUDE.md with AI instructions
- [x] Create base HTML structure with full-screen layout
- [x] Implement animated gradient background with smooth transitions
- [x] Implement logo full-body animations (shake, rotate, tilt)
- [x] Implement logo internal SVG element animations (neon, color change, explosion)
- [x] Create URL parameter configuration system

## In Progress
- [ ] Testing all animation combinations
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Planned Features

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements
- [ ] Add more gradient color schemes (presets)
- [ ] Add animation speed controls via URL parameters
- [ ] Add animation intensity controls
- [ ] Create visual configuration panel (optional UI overlay)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for toggling animations

### Phase 2: Advanced Animations
- [ ] Add particle effects around logo
- [ ] Implement parallax scrolling effects (if multi-page)
- [ ] Add transition effects between animation states
- [ ] Create custom easing functions for smoother animations
- [ ] Add sound effects (optional, toggleable)

### Phase 3: Multi-Page Support
- [ ] Create page routing system using URL hash
- [ ] Design additional page layouts
- [ ] Add page transition animations
- [ ] Create navigation system

### Phase 4: Customization
- [ ] Add theme presets (dark, light, colorful, minimal)
- [ ] Support custom logo upload (localStorage/sessionStorage)
- [ ] Create animation timeline editor
- [ ] Add export/import configuration feature

### Phase 5: Polish
- [ ] Add loading screen
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Add accessibility features (reduced motion support)
- [ ] Create documentation for all URL parameters
- [ ] Add analytics (optional, privacy-focused)

## Known Issues
- None currently

## Future Ideas
- WebGL background effects
- Three.js integration for 3D logo animations
- SVG path morphing animations
- Interactive mode (mouse/touch interaction with logo)
- Audio visualization sync with animations
- Social media sharing with custom configurations
